- ✅ **Basic UI Layout** - Three-panel layout (Sidebar + Main + AI Panel) renders

### Vault System
- ✅ **Vault Selection** - Folder picker dialog works (with permissions fixed)
- ✅ **Vault Persistence** - Selected vault path saves to Tauri store
- ✅ **File Reading** - Can read text files from vault
- ✅ **File Writing** - Can write text files (using `writeTextFile`)
- ✅ **Hidden File Filtering** - Automatically skips `.obsidian`, `.git`, etc.

### Navigation Components
- ✅ **Sidebar Structure** - Folder tree navigation component exists
- ✅ **Breadcrumbs** - Path breadcrumb component exists
- ✅ **Terminal Navigation** - Terminal command parser implemented
- ✅ **Command Palette** - Kbar integration with actions defined

### Components (Built)
- ✅ **VaultSelector** - Vault folder picker component
- ✅ **Sidebar** - Recursive folder tree viewer
- ✅ **Breadcrumbs** - Clickable path navigation
- ✅ **TerminalNav** - Terminal-style command input
- ✅ **CommandPalette** - Command palette with actions
- ✅ **Editor** - Tiptap editor component (with SSR fix)
- ✅ **Canvas** - Excalidraw canvas component
- ✅ **AIPanel** - AI assistant sidebar component

### State Management
- ✅ **Zustand Stores** - All stores implemented:
  - `useVaultStore` - Vault path and current file
  - `useNavStore` - Navigation path and terminal visibility
  - `useAIStore` - AI messages and processing state

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Incomplete

### Critical Issues
1. **Sidebar Not Loading** - May need file watching or refresh mechanism
2. **Editor Not Loading Files** - May need to verify file loading logic
3. **Canvas Not Persisting** - Needs verification of save functionality
4. **Terminal Commands** - Commands exist but may need testing

### Functionality Needs Testing
- ⚠️ **File Operations** - Read/write works but needs end-to-end testing
- ⚠️ **Navigation** - Components exist but integration may need fixes
- ⚠️ **Auto-save** - Editor has auto-save but needs verification
- ⚠️ **Command Palette** - Actions defined but need testing
- ⚠️ **AI Assistant** - Basic structure exists, needs API key setup

### Missing Features
- ❌ **File Creation** - Command palette has "New Note" but may need directory creation
- ❌ **File Deletion** - Function exists but not exposed in UI
- ❌ **Search** - Placeholder only, not implemented
- ❌ **Fuzzy Search** - Fuse.js installed but not integrated
- ❌ **File Watching** - No live updates when files change externally
- ❌ **Multi-vault** - Can switch but no vault management UI
- ❌ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Command palette accessible but shortcuts may need testing

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Testing & Debugging** (High Priority)
```bash
# Test each feature manually:
- [ ] Select vault → verify sidebar loads
- [ ] Create new note → verify file appears in sidebar
- [ ] Open note → verify editor loads content
- [ ] Edit note → verify auto-save works
- [ ] Open canvas → verify Excalidraw loads
- [ ] Use terminal commands (cd, ls, open)
- [ ] Test command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K)
```

### 2. **Fix Sidebar Loading** (High Priority)
- [ ] Ensure sidebar refreshes when vault is selected
- [ ] Add refresh button or auto-refresh mechanism
- [ ] Verify file tree displays correctly
- [ ] Test clicking files opens them

### 3. **Verify Editor Functionality** (High Priority)
- [ ] Test file loading works
- [ ] Test auto-save debouncing
- [ ] Test markdown rendering
- [ ] Fix any content parsing issues

### 4. **File Creation** (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Ensure `notes/` and `canvases/` directories are created automatically
- [ ] Test "New Note" command creates file
- [ ] Test "New Canvas" command creates file
- [ ] Verify files appear in sidebar immediately

### 5. **UI Polish** (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add loading states throughout
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add toast notifications for actions
- [ ] Style improvements

### 6. **AI Integration** (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Test API key setup flow
- [ ] Verify RAG queries work
- [ ] Test citation display
- [ ] Improve error handling

### 7. **Advanced Features** (Low Priority)
- [ ] File search with Fuse.js
- [ ] File watching for live updates
- [ ] Multi-vault management UI
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts documentation
